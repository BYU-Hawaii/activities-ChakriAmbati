            <p>Indian curries are incredibly diverse, ranging from the creamy and mildly spiced butter chicken of the north to the fiery and tangy vindaloo of Goa, which reflects Portuguese influences. South Indian curries, such as the coconut-based Kerala fish curry, are known for their distinct flavors and use of local ingredients like tamarind and curry leaves. Additionally, vegetarian curries like the rich and hearty paneer tikka masala and the spicy, tomato-based baingan bharta highlight the versatility and depth of Indian vegetarian cuisine.</p>

            <h1> <figcaption> Roti and Curry</figcaption></h1>
            <p>Roti and curry is a quintessential Indian meal, combining the soft, unleavened flatbread roti with a variety of flavorful curries. This pairing allows the roti to soak up the rich, spiced gravies of curries such as chicken masala, aloo gobi, or dal, creating a harmonious blend of textures and tastes. Roti and curry is not only a staple in Indian households but also enjoyed worldwide for its comforting and satisfying nature.</p>
